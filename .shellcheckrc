# ShellCheck configuration for dotfiles repository

# Default shell dialect (bash is most compatible)
shell=bash

# Set minimum severity level to warning (ignore style suggestions)
# Options: error, warning, info, style
severity=warning

# Disable specific warnings that are acceptable in dotfiles context
# SC2148: Tips depend on target shell and yours is unknown (files without shebang)
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately (common pattern in shell functions)
# SC2162: read without -r (acceptable in interactive shell functions)
# SC2164: Use cd || exit (in shell functions/aliases, we don't want to exit the shell)
# SC2181: Check exit code directly ([ $? -ne 0 ] is clear and readable in scripts)
# SC2009: Consider using pgrep (sometimes grep is intentional for broader matching)
# SC2250: Prefer braces around variable references (style preference)
# SC2292: Prefer [[ ]] over [ ] (style preference)
